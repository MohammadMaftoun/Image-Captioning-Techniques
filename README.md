# Image-Captioning-Techniques

Welcome to the Image Captioning Techniques repository! üì∏üìù

This repository is dedicated to various image captioning techniques, where the goal is to generate meaningful textual descriptions for images automatically. Image captioning is a fascinating intersection of computer vision and natural language processing (NLP), used in applications such as automated content creation, accessibility for visually impaired individuals, and more.

    Basic Methods:
        Template-based captioning
        Rule-based approaches

    Classical Approaches:
        Bag of Words (BoW) with image features
        Statistical methods (n-grams, HMM)

    Deep Learning Models:
        Encoder-Decoder Architecture
        Show and Tell Model (CNN + RNN)
        Show, Attend, and Tell (CNN + Attention Mechanism)
        Attention-based LSTM and GRU models
        Dense Captioning (Generates multiple captions for different image regions)

    Transformers and Advanced Techniques:
        Image Captioning with Transformers (ViT, DETR, etc.)
        Vision-Language Pretrained Models (e.g., CLIP, BLIP, OFA)
        CNN + Transformer Hybrid Models
        Vision-and-Language Pretraining (VLP)

    End-to-End Pipelines:
        Preprocessing (Data augmentation, Tokenization)
        Feature extraction using pre-trained CNNs (ResNet, Inception, VGG)
        Training and inference with image-caption datasets

# Datasets

    COCO Captioning Dataset: Standard dataset for training and evaluating image captioning models.
    Flickr8k, Flickr30k: Popular datasets for image captioning tasks.
    Conceptual Captions: Web-scraped image-caption dataset for real-world captioning.

# Getting Started

Instructions for setting up the environment, training models, evaluating performance, and running inference on custom images.

# Pretrained Models

This repository includes pre-trained models on standard datasets, allowing users to generate captions for their own images.

# Contributions

Contributions are welcome! Whether you want to implement new image captioning methods, improve existing models, or enhance the documentation, feel free to submit pull requests.
